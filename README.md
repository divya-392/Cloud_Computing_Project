# Cloud Native Application Project  
## AWS Container Service Deployment: A Comparative Study of Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon ECS

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code, configuration files, and deployment artefacts for a comparative deployment of a containerised catalog service application using two Amazon Web Services (AWS) container deployment platforms:

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Docker platform)
- Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) on AWS Fargate

The objective of the project is to evaluate these services based on abstraction level, deployment complexity, operational responsibility, cloud-native features, and developer experience.

A GitOps-based CI/CD pipeline implemented using GitHub Actions is used to automate the build and deployment process.

This repository supports the accompanying academic report titled:
